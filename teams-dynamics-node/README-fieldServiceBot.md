# Field Service - `fieldServiceBot`

## How to register the bot in the Bot Framework portal

In order to create a bot you need to first register it in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Choose to *Create a resource*, or alternatively go to an existing *resource group* and click *Add*
2. Search for *Bot channels registration* and then click *Create*
3. Give the bot a handle (ex: `fieldServiceBot`), choose your subscription and resource group
4. For the messaging endpoint, use this: `https://Wictor Wilen-teams-field-service.azurewebsites.net/api/messages`
5. Choose to *Auto create Microsoft App ID and Password*
6. Click *Create*
7. Wait for Azure to finish its magic and when done choose to go to resource
8. On the bot page choose *Channels* and choose to add Microsoft Teams as a channel
9. Next, choose the *Settings* and click on *Manage* next to Microsoft App Id
10. In the Bot app portal, generate a new app password and store it securely - you will need them for your `.env` file or add them as application settings for the hosting web site (see below)

## How to configure the bot

The App Id and App Secret, generated during the registration, for the bot are read from the `MICROSOFT_APP_ID` and `MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD` environment variables, specified in the `.env` file. These can be configured in the Azure Web App under *Application Settings > App Settings*.

## How to test the bot locally

The bot can be tested and debugged locally using the `gulp serve --debug` command and using the _Microsoft Bot Framework Channel Emulator_. You should also update the App Id and Password in the `.env` file.

Another great way to test and debug bots running locally is to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) along with `gulp serve`. Ngrok allows you to create a secure tunnel from localhost to the Internet. Download and install ngrok, and then type `ngrok http 3007` at a command prompt. Ngrok will start, and will create a tunnel between localhost:3007 and https://########.ngrok.io (the ######## will change every time you start ngrok). Run `gulp serve` in another command prompt. Change your messaging endpoint in the Bot Framework portal to https://########.ngrok.io/api/messages. http://localhost:4040 will contain a log of all the traffic between your bot and Teams, and you can use a debugger such as Visual Studio Code to set breakpoints and examine variables.
